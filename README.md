Sending a message to a Telegram channel 
In order to be able to do so, you will have first to:
Create a Telegram public channel
Create a Telegram BOT via BotFather
Set the bot as administrator in your channel
Provided that you did the above, now you can send a message to your channel by issuing an HTTP GET request to the Telegram BOT API at the following URL:
https://api.telegram.org/bot[BOT_API_KEY]/sendMessage?chat_id=[MY_CHANNEL_NAME]&text=[MY_MESSAGE_TEXT]
where:

BOT_API_KEY is the API Key generated by BotFather when you created your bot

MY_CHANNEL_NAME is the handle of your channel (e.g. @my_channel_name)

MY_MESSAGE_TEXT is the message you want to send (URL-encoded)
